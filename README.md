## 📖 Overview

**Civic Connect India** is an open-source platform designed to bridge the communication gap between Indian citizens and local government bodies. 

In a country with rapid urbanization, efficiently managing civic issues (like road maintenance, waste management, and street lighting) is a massive challenge. This project aims to solve that by providing a transparent, real-time interface for reporting issues and tracking their resolution.

### 🌟 Key Features

* **📍 Geo-Tagging:** Automatically pinpoints the location of reported issues (potholes, garbage dumps, etc.) using GPS.
* **🗣️ Multi-Language Support:** Interface available in English, Hindi, Tamil, and other regional languages to ensure inclusivity.
* **📊 Real-Time Tracking:** Citizens can track the status of their complaints from "Reported" to "Resolved."
* **🤖 AI Categorization:** Uses Machine Learning to automatically classify images (e.g., distinguishing a "water leak" from a "pothole") to route them to the correct department.
* **📴 Offline Mode:** Allows users in low-connectivity areas to draft reports and sync them when online.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React Native / Flutter (for Mobile), React.js (for Admin Dashboard)
* **Backend:** Node.js / Django / FastAPI
* **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL
* **Maps:** Mapbox / Google Maps API / OpenStreetMap
* **AI/ML:** TensorFlow / PyTorch (for image recognition)
